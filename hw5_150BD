	I would like to present on the role of Big Data in dating websites and what it has revealed about our society and psychology as a whole. OkCupid and other social dating sites allow us to study human interaction and psychology in ways we have never been able to in the past.

	I would like to explore the industry of online dating, discoveries that have been made through online dating and their implications in the fields of psychology. I will then look into what may lie in the future and how the industry will adapt. 

	I am very open to suggestions so please let me know if you think this should be more focused or changed.
